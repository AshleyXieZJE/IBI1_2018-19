Practical 12 was a little challenging, but it was fun. 
The problems in this practical was somehow related to reality and I enjoyed solving these problems very much. 
I was not sure about the importance of probabilistic models before the practical.
After I saw the output was so different every time, I realized that probabilistic models can be used in predicting how things will go in reality.
