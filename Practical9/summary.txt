About 90% of the sequences for human and mouse SOD2 protein is the same compared to 5% between human/mouse and random. 
It is not surprising that SOD2 proteins are similar between different species because their functions are the same. 
This also indicates that human beings and mice probably have a common ancestor. 
However, some differences still exist, which suggests that identical amino acid sequence is not necessary for proteins to accomplish the same task.
